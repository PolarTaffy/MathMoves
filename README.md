MathMoves is an interactive educational tool designed to promote math-solving skills among elementary school students. By combining multiple-choice problems with real-time drawing capabilities, this game provides an engaging way for children to work through math challenges.

Features
Interactive Problem Solving: Players are presented with multiple-choice math problems and have the option to use a virtual pencil to work out solutions directly on the screen.
Timer and Scoring System: A 4-minute timer adds an element of challenge, and players receive a score based on their performance at the end of each session.
Promotion of STEM Education: In addition to general math challenges, children can choose from different modes such as Multiplication, Subtraction, Long Division, or an All Math mode to tailor their learning experience.
MathMoves addresses socioeconomic issues by providing a platform for learning that is accessible to all students, regardless of their access to tutoring or technology resources. By offering diverse modes and personalized feedback, it aims to bridge educational gaps and promote inclusivity in math education.

Feedback and Adaptive Learning
The program intelligently tracks the problems that users struggle with, allowing for targeted support and feedback. If a player consistently struggles with subtraction, for example, the game will adjust by presenting more subtraction problems to reinforce learning in that area. Additionally, the game utilizes machine learning to generate supportive feedback tailored to each player's individual progress and challenges.

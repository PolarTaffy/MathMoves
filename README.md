# MathMoves: An Interactive Math Game
This project was created for the Black Leaders Hackathon @ Georgia Tech in 2024, and placed 1st in the advanced track.

MathMoves is a webcam game written in Python that reinforces elementary math skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The screen displays questions and the user must physically move their body over to the answer to select it. After the user completes a series of questions, the program then outputs personalized feedback on their performance and how to improve, using Google Gemini.

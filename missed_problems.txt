Oh dear, it looks like you have encountered some tricky subtraction problems. Let's take a closer look at what might have happened.

First, let's talk about the problem "3 - -8." You might have gotten confused because the second number has two minus signs in front of it. When we have two minus signs in a row, it actually means a plus sign. So, "3 - -8" is the same as "3 + 8." That means the answer is 11.

It's okay to make mistakes, especially when we are learning new things. The important thing is to learn from them. Next time you encounter a subtraction problem with two minus signs, remember that it's really a plus sign.

Here are some other types of subtraction problems that you might find challenging:

* Problems with zeros: Like "10 - 0." Remember that subtracting zero from any number doesn't change the number.
* Problems with large numbers: Like "999 - 567." Break down the numbers into smaller parts to make them easier to subtract.
* Word problems: Like "John had 5 apples. He gave 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does John have left?" Understand the words in the problem and write down the numbers before subtracting.

Don't worry if you don't get everything right away. With practice, you'll become a subtraction superstar! Let's keep working at it together.
